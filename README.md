# Tower of Hanoi puzzle was invented by the french mathematician "Edouard Lucas" in 1883.
# The name "Tower of Hanoi" is derived from a fictional legend involving a temple (sometimes located in Hanoi, Vietnam), where priests move 64 golden disks according  to the puzzle's rulesâ€”a story invented by Lucas to popularize the puzzle.
